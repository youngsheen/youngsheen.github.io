I am currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), supervised by Prof. [Linli Xu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~linlixu). My research interests inlcude:
- Generative Models
- Multimodal learning

Recently, I have been focusing on Multimodal LLMs, specifically exploring the unified model across text, vision, and speech with multimodal
inputs and multimodal outputs processed by a single neural network. I am currently seeking an internship (our lab is also open to collaborations) to explore the development of an advanced GPT-4o-like voice model that supports streaming, full-duplex, fine-grained perceptual speech dialogue systems, though not limited to this. Please feel free to reach out to me at zyx2016@mail.ustc.edu.cn
